  My favorite courses are data collection and analysis, database establishment and project change process management. Because they are interesting and can bring me a lot of help. Through them, I can learn some uses of establishing database and database. I also learned about the function and method of questionnaire survey. Also learned how to communicate with the boss and customers when the project changes. These are of great help to me.

  <br>
  My strengths are English speaking and understanding, computer use. I am an easy-going, independent and enthusiastic person. But I'm lazy and like to procrastinate. I'm easy to get out of control when I'm angry. I am impatient, eager to succeed in doing things, not enterprising and self righteous.
  <br>
  <br>
  I want to overcome laziness, adhere to it every day, form the habit of self-discipline, and do not procrastinate. Control your emotions. We should study actively and establish a self-motivated spirit. I will help my classmates repair computers by using computers. Through my warm personality and easy to get along with, I can make more friends.
